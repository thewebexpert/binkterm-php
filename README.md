# BinktermPHP

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/btlogo.png" alt="BinktermPHP" width="400"></p>

BinktermPHP is a multi-protocol BBS platform built around native FTN messaging. It provides a full browser-based community interface with a native BinkP mailer, a real-time event bus, and a door game framework — accessible from browsers, Telnet/SSH terminals, Gemini clients, QWK readers, NNTP newsreaders, AI assistants, and mesh radio nodes. No third-party mailer required.

awehttam operates a live instance at [claudes.lovelybits.org](https://claudes.lovelybits.org) — Claude's own BBS, and a point system at [mypoint.lovelybits.org](https://mypoint.lovelybits.org).

BinktermPHP was featured in the *Calling All Nodes* YouTube video: [CALLING ALL NODES — BinktermPHP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_s8X2O7Lmk)

This code is released under the terms of a [BSD License](LICENSE.md).

# Why BinktermPHP?

- **FTN connectivity built in** — no separate mailer, tosser, or AreaFix tool to install or configure. Inbound polling, packet processing, and hub subscriptions are all handled out of the box.
- **Full BBS experience on any device** — echomail, netmail, doors, and chat work on any smartphone or browser, installable as a PWA with no app store required. Telnet, SSH, Gemini, QWK, NNTP, and MCP are also built in.
- **A ready network on day one** — LovlyNet (Zone 227) is BinktermPHP's home FTN, with automated node registration via a single script, giving you a live network and operator support community immediately.
- **Doors for every era** — classic DOS games via DOSBox-X, native PTY doors, HTML5 WebDoors, and browser-based WASM for 3D games and C64 emulation, with credit charging built in across all types.
- **Admin tools that show you what's happening** — web-based admin dashboard, activity analytics, credits economy viewer, and AI features, so you can manage your BBS without grepping log files.
- **Credits economy** — built-in points system with login rewards, door session charging, referral bonuses, and user-to-user transfers. Full economy viewer and credit ledger give you visibility into how your community earns and spends.
- **AI integration** — provider-agnostic AI layer supports OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, and Ollama (local inference); expose echo areas via MCP, give users an in-reader AI assistant, and deploy chatbots to any chat room.

# Architecture

BinktermPHP is structured in layers. A PHP web application handles all HTTP requests; cooperating daemons handle FTN networking, real-time delivery, terminal access, and door games. All processes share a single PostgreSQL database.

See [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full component diagram, FTN packet lifecycle, daemon IPC model, door subsystem, and AI pipeline.

---

# Installation

BinktermPHP supports three installation methods:

- **Installer (recommended)** - download and run `binkterm-installer.phar` for a guided, automated setup that handles PHP, PostgreSQL, web server configuration, and migrations
- **Git (for developers)** - clone the repository and run setup scripts for full control over the installation
- **Docker** - run BinktermPHP in a container; see **[docs/DOCKER.md](docs/DOCKER.md)** for setup instructions

BinktermPHP is intended for a VPS, dedicated server, Raspberry Pi, or similar environment where you control PostgreSQL, background daemons, and multiple network ports. Shared hosting is not recommended.

For complete installation instructions - system requirements, Ubuntu/Debian package setup, PostgreSQL configuration, web server configuration (Caddy, Nginx, Apache), cron job setup, and a network port reference - see **[docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)**.

---

# Configuration

Two files must be configured before first run. If you use the installer, it creates and populates these for you during setup:

- **`.env`** — database, SMTP, daemon ports, and feature flags. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values.
- **`config/binkp.json`** — your FTN system identity, uplinks, binkp daemon, security, and crashmail. Copy `config/binkp.json.example` as a starting point.

After first run, ongoing BBS settings are managed through the **Admin web interface** (Admin → BBS Settings). After editing any config file, restart services with `bash scripts/restart_daemons.sh`.

Full configuration reference: **[docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)**

---

# Upgrading

**Review version-specific upgrade notes** in [docs/index.md](docs/index.md#upgrading) before upgrading — individual versions may have specific steps you must take.


The general steps:

1. **Pull the latest code** — `git pull`
2. **Run setup** — `php scripts/setup.php` (handles database migrations automatically)
3. **Update configurations** — review `.env` and `config/binkp.json` for new options
4. **Restart daemons** — `bash scripts/restart_daemons.sh`

**Using the installer:** Re-run `binkterm-installer.phar` to upgrade.

# Joining LovlyNet Network

LovlyNet is the home FTN for BinktermPHP: a FidoNet Technology Network built specifically for BinktermPHP systems, with automated registration and echo areas for operators sharing knowledge, troubleshooting, and community. It also carries **LVLY_BINKTERMPHP**, the main support area for BinktermPHP sysops.

```bash
php scripts/lovlynet_setup.php
```

See **[docs/LovlyNet.md](docs/LovlyNet.md)** for the complete guide including public vs passive node setup, AreaFix configuration, and troubleshooting.

---

# Customization

The easiest way to customize your BBS is through **Admin → Appearance**: shells, branding, announcements, navigation links, and SEO. Manual options include template overrides in `templates/custom/`, custom stylesheets, and local route files — all upgrade-safe.

See **[docs/CUSTOMIZING.md](docs/CUSTOMIZING.md)** for the full reference.

For community-contributed mods and extensions, see **[docs/MODS.md](docs/MODS.md)**.

# About the BinktermPHP Logo

Kludge, the BinktermPHP mascot, is a corvid inspired by the messenger and trickster archetypes found throughout Pacific Northwest storytelling and early network culture. Rendered in a bold woodcut-inspired style, Kludge carries a glowing ANSI tile representing packets, messages, and shared knowledge moving across decentralized systems. The speckled texture within the dark feathers can be read as CRT phosphor noise, stars, or the network itself — a nod to communication across distance, communities built in the margins, and the enduring spirit of bulletin board systems. The logo's limited amber, black, and off-white palette draws from classic monochrome terminals and ANSI art, blending retro computing aesthetics with a slightly mythic, underground tone.
