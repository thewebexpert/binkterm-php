# Door Games - Sysop Documentation

BinktermPHP supports three types of door games, each suited to different use cases.

| Type | Description | Doc |
|------|-------------|-----|
| **DOS Doors** | Classic DOS games (LORD, TradeWars, etc.) running under DOSBox-X | [DOSDoors.md](DOSDoors.md) |
| **Native Doors** | Linux/Windows binaries or scripts running via PTY | [NativeDoors.md](NativeDoors.md) |
| **RLogin Doors** | Connects out to a remote BBS or service (e.g. Synchronet) over the rlogin protocol | [RLoginDoors.md](RLoginDoors.md) |
| **WebDoors** | Browser-based HTML5/PHP games embedded in an iframe | [WebDoors.md](WebDoors.md) |
| **JS-DOS Doors** | 3D/graphical DOS games running in the browser via js-dos (DOSBox WASM) | [JSDOSDoors.md](JSDOSDoors.md) |
| **C64 Doors** | Commodore 64 PRG/D64/ROM programs running in the jsc64 emulator | [C64Doors.md](C64Doors.md) |

C64 Doors, WebDoors, and JS-DOS Doors run entirely in the browser and require no additional server-side components. DOS Doors, Native Doors, and RLogin Doors all require the **multiplexing bridge** described below.

## Choosing a Door Type: DOSBox-X vs JS-DOS

BinktermPHP supports two ways to run DOS software: **DOSBox-X** (server-side, used by DOS Doors) and **js-dos** (browser-side, used by JS-DOS Doors). Both emulate a DOS environment, but they are suited to very different categories of software.

### DOSBox-X — Server-Side (Best for Classic BBS Doors)

DOSBox-X runs on the server as a headless process, connected to the user's browser via a WebSocket terminal. This is the right choice for traditional BBS door games like LORD, TradeWars 2002, and BRE.

**Why DOSBox-X works well for door games:**

- **Drop file support.** Door games expect a `DOOR.SYS` (or similar) drop file containing the caller's name, baud rate, node number, and time remaining. The bridge generates this file server-side before launching DOSBox, where the values are authoritative and cannot be tampered with. `DOOR.SYS`, `DOOR32.SYS` (native doors), and `BBSDEV.DRP` (experimental, both door types) are supported via the `dropfile_format` manifest field — see `docs/DOSDoors.md` and `docs/NativeDoors.md`.
- **Multi-user node management.** Traditional door games assign each concurrent user a node number and may write to shared inter-node communication files. The bridge allocates node numbers server-side, manages the full pool, and ensures no two sessions collide.
- **Shared real filesystem.** All DOSBox-X instances on the server mount the same real host directories. This is how multi-node door games work: LORD's inter-player messages, TradeWars 2002's game database, and similar shared state are just files on disk that every node reads and writes concurrently. Because the filesystem is real and shared, no special synchronization layer is needed — it works exactly the same as it did on a physical BBS.
- **Terminal I/O only.** Door games communicate via text/ANSI over a serial-like connection — exactly what the bridge multiplexes. No graphics hardware, no WebAssembly, no browser GPU involved.
- **Controlled execution environment.** The server controls the filesystem, clock, and process. The game cannot be influenced by anything the user does outside the terminal window.

**Trade-offs:**

- Every session spawns a DOSBox-X process on the server (60–100 MB RAM each on x64).
- Requires DOSBox-X installed on the server and the multiplexing bridge running.
- Output is ANSI/CP437 text — no graphical display.

### js-dos — Browser-Side (Best for Graphical/3D Games)

js-dos is a WebAssembly build of DOSBox that runs entirely inside the user's browser. No server process is spawned. This is the right choice for graphical and 3D games like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, and Heretic.

**Why js-dos works well for graphical games:**

- **GPU and CPU offloaded to the client.** 3D games are computationally expensive. Running them server-side would require a dedicated CPU core (or more) per session. With js-dos, the user's own hardware does the work.
- **No per-session server process.** The server only handles session tracking and save file sync — the emulator itself never runs on the server.
- **Full graphical output.** js-dos renders to a `<canvas>` element with full VGA/SVGA support. Sound runs in the browser via the Web Audio API.
- **Save state sync.** The browser uploads save files to the user's private file area on the server so progress persists across sessions.
- **Multiplayer via relay.** IPX-based network play (Doom, Duke3D, etc.) is supported via an IPX-over-WebSocket relay in the bridge — no server-side DOSBox needed.

**Trade-offs:**

- **Isolated virtual filesystem.** Each js-dos session gets its own in-memory virtual filesystem inside the browser. There is no mechanism for two browser sessions to share files directly — multi-user coordination requires an explicit server-side relay or API. This rules out the shared-file inter-node patterns that classic door games depend on.
- The execution environment is the user's browser. A technically skilled user can inspect or modify the JavaScript running the emulator. For door games where server-enforced rules matter (time limits, credits, inter-node state), this is a significant concern.
- Game assets served from `public_html/jsdos-doors/` are publicly downloadable without authentication. Sysops must only place files they are licensed to distribute there.
- Browser performance varies. A low-end device may struggle with CPU-intensive 3D titles.

### Security: Why Drop Files Must Not Run Client-Side

Classic BBS door games depend on the drop file to establish the player's identity, remaining time, and node number. If a door game ran in the user's browser (as js-dos does), the drop file would either have to be generated client-side or fetched and injected into the virtual filesystem by JavaScript running in the user's browser.

In either case, a user who can modify the JavaScript — or intercept the asset delivery — could alter the drop file contents: grant themselves unlimited time, change their username, or impersonate another user. Because door game data (scores, resources, credits) is often stored in shared files on a per-node basis, this could corrupt the game state for all players.

DOSBox-X doors avoid this entirely: the bridge generates the drop file on the server before the DOSBox process starts, using session data stored in the database. The DOS environment never sees user-controlled input until the game is already running inside the terminal.

**Summary: use the right tool for the job.**

| Consideration | DOSBox-X (DOS Doors) | js-dos (JS-DOS Doors) |
|---|---|---|
| Execution location | Server | Browser |
| Drop file / node management | Yes — server-authoritative | Not applicable |
| Filesystem | Shared real host filesystem | Isolated per-session virtual FS |
| Multi-user inter-node comms | Yes — via shared files on disk | Relay only (multiplayer games) |
| Graphical/3D output | No (ANSI/text only) | Yes (canvas/WebGL) |
| Server resource cost | ~60–100 MB RAM per session | Near zero |
| Tamper risk | None (server controls env) | Moderate (JS is inspectable) |
| Best for | LORD, TradeWars, BRE, DOOR games | Doom, Duke3D, Heretic, Wolf3D |

## Multiplexing Bridge

DOS Doors and Native Doors share a single long-running Node.js bridge process (`scripts/dosbox-bridge/multiplexing-server.js`). The bridge:

- Listens for WebSocket connections from browsers on a single port (default: 6001)
- Authenticates sessions against the database
- For **DOS Doors**: launches DOSBox and multiplexes TCP I/O
- For **Native Doors**: spawns the door executable via `node-pty` and multiplexes PTY I/O

```
[Browser] ──→ wss://bbs.example.com:6001 ──→ [Multiplexing Bridge]
                       (WebSocket)              (Node.js Process)
                                                  ├──→ TCP ←── DOSBox → DOS Door
                                                  └──→ PTY  ←─ Native Binary
```

Both door types use the same bridge process, the same WebSocket port, and the same session database table. You only need to run one bridge instance to support both.

---

## Prerequisites

### Node.js

Node.js 18.x or newer is required. Tested with Node.js 24.

- Linux: `sudo apt install nodejs` or download from https://nodejs.org/
- Windows/macOS: Download from https://nodejs.org/

Verify: `node --version`

### Bridge Dependencies

Install Node.js dependencies from the bridge directory:

```bash
cd scripts/dosbox-bridge
npm install
```

This installs:
- `ws` — WebSocket server
- `iconv-lite` — CP437 ↔ UTF-8 encoding (DOS doors)
- `pg` — PostgreSQL client for session authentication
- `node-pty` — PTY support for native doors
- `dotenv` — reads `.env` configuration

### Database Schema

The bridge reads session records from the database. Tables are created by `scripts/setup.php`:

```bash
php scripts/setup.php
```

---

## Configuration

The bridge reads settings from your `.env` file. Shared settings relevant to both door types:

```bash
# WebSocket port for the multiplexing bridge (default: 6001)
DOSDOOR_WS_PORT=6001

# WebSocket bind address (default: 127.0.0.1)
# Use 127.0.0.1 behind a reverse proxy (recommended for production)
# Use 0.0.0.0 for direct access during development
DOSDOOR_WS_BIND_HOST=127.0.0.1

# WebSocket URL seen by browsers (optional - auto-detected if not set)
# Set this if you are behind an SSL-terminating reverse proxy
# DOSDOOR_WS_URL=wss://bbs.example.com:6001
# DOSDOOR_WS_URL=wss://bbs.example.com/dosdoor

# Maximum simultaneous door sessions across all door types (default: 10)
# Each session uses one node number (1 to MAX_SESSIONS)
DOSDOOR_MAX_SESSIONS=10

# Comma-separated list of proxy IP addresses whose X-Forwarded-For header is trusted
# for client IP resolution in logs. Only connections arriving from one of these IPs
# will have their remote address replaced by the forwarded value. (default: 127.0.0.1)
# DOSDOOR_TRUSTED_PROXIES=127.0.0.1,10.0.0.1
```

For DOS-door-specific settings (DOSBox executable, disconnect timeout, etc.) see [DOSDoors.md](DOSDoors.md#configuration).

## Running the Bridge

### Development / Testing

```bash
node scripts/dosbox-bridge/multiplexing-server.js
```

Expected output:

```
=== DOSBox Door Bridge - Multiplexing Server ===
WebSocket Port: 6001
Bind Address: 127.0.0.1
TCP Port Range: 5000-5100
Database: binktest@localhost:5432/binktest

[WS] Server listening on 127.0.0.1:6001
[WS] Waiting for connections...

Bridge server started successfully!
Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

### Production — Daemon mode

The bridge has built-in daemon support via the `--daemon` flag:

```bash
node scripts/dosbox-bridge/multiplexing-server.js --daemon
```

This forks a detached background process and exits immediately, returning the shell prompt. Output:

```
Starting in daemon mode (PID: 12345)
PID file: /path/to/binkterm-php/data/run/multiplexing-server.pid
Log file: /path/to/binkterm-php/data/logs/multiplexing-server.log
```

The daemon:
- Writes its PID to `data/run/multiplexing-server.pid`
- Logs to `data/logs/multiplexing-server.log`
- Detects a stale PID file and cleans it up automatically on start
- Refuses to start a second instance if one is already running
- Responds to `SIGTERM` / `SIGINT` for clean shutdown

**Start on boot (cron):**

```bash
crontab -e
# Add:
@reboot cd /path/to/binkterm && /usr/bin/node scripts/dosbox-bridge/multiplexing-server.js --daemon
```

**Stop the daemon:**

```bash
kill $(cat data/run/multiplexing-server.pid)
```

### Production — Linux (systemd)

A service unit example is provided at `docs/dosdoor-bridge.service.example`.

1. **Copy the service file:**
   ```bash
   sudo cp docs/dosdoor-bridge.service.example /etc/systemd/system/dosdoor-bridge.service
   ```

2. **Edit the service file** and update:
   - `User=` — the user that runs BinktermPHP (e.g. `binkterm`)
   - `WorkingDirectory=` — full path to the BinktermPHP directory
   - `ExecStart=` — full paths to `node` and `multiplexing-server.js`

3. **Enable and start:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable dosdoor-bridge
   sudo systemctl start dosdoor-bridge
   ```

4. **Check status:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status dosdoor-bridge
   sudo journalctl -u dosdoor-bridge -f
   ```

### Production — Windows (NSSM)

Use [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/) to run the bridge as a Windows service:

```cmd
nssm install DoorBridge "C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe" "C:\path\to\binktest\scripts\dosbox-bridge\multiplexing-server.js"
nssm set DoorBridge AppDirectory "C:\path\to\binktest"
nssm start DoorBridge
```

## Reverse Proxy

If your BBS is served over HTTPS, browsers will require the WebSocket connection to also be secure (`wss://`). Two common approaches:

**Option A — Expose the bridge on a separate port with SSL:**
Configure your reverse proxy to terminate SSL on a dedicated port (e.g. 6001) and forward to the bridge on `127.0.0.1:6001`. Set `DOSDOOR_WS_URL=wss://bbs.example.com:6001`.

**Caddy** (`Caddyfile`):
```caddy
bbs.example.com:6001 {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:6001 {
        flush_interval -1    # disable buffering for real-time terminal I/O
    }
}
```
Caddy automatically handles WebSocket upgrade headers and sets the `Host` header. No additional directives are needed for WebSocket proxying.

**NGINX** (`nginx.conf` / site config):
```nginx
server {
    listen 6001 ssl;
    server_name bbs.example.com;

    ssl_certificate     /etc/ssl/certs/bbs.example.com.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/bbs.example.com.key;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6001;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_buffering off;       # disable buffering for real-time terminal I/O
        proxy_read_timeout 3600;   # keep long-lived WebSocket connections alive
    }
}
```

**Apache** (requires `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_http`, `mod_proxy_wstunnel`, and `mod_ssl`):
```apache
Listen 6001
<VirtualHost *:6001>
    ServerName bbs.example.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/bbs.example.com.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/bbs.example.com.key

    ProxyTimeout 3600              # keep long-lived WebSocket connections alive

    ProxyPass / ws://127.0.0.1:6001/
    ProxyPassReverse / ws://127.0.0.1:6001/
</VirtualHost>
```
`mod_proxy_wstunnel` does not buffer WebSocket frames, so no explicit flush directive is needed.

**Option B — Path-based proxy:**
Forward a path to the bridge. Set `DOSDOOR_WS_URL=wss://bbs.example.com/doorplayersocket`.

The path `/doorplayersocket` is recommended — it is descriptive enough to be self-documenting and unlikely to conflict with any existing application routes.

nginx example for Option B:
```nginx
location /doorplayersocket {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:6001;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_read_timeout 3600;
}
```

Apache example for Option B (requires `mod_proxy`, `mod_proxy_http`, and `mod_proxy_wstunnel`):
```apache
# Enable required modules if not already active:
#   a2enmod proxy proxy_http proxy_wstunnel

ProxyPass /doorplayersocket ws://127.0.0.1:6001/
ProxyPassReverse /doorplayersocket ws://127.0.0.1:6001/
```

If your VirtualHost uses `SSLProxyEngine`, add:
```apache
SSLProxyEngine on
```
