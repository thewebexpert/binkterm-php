## Mods

### Door Button Filter Mod

Adds a category filter bar to the Doors page (`/games`) — filter door games by type
(RLOGIN, WEB, NATIVE, DOS, JS-DOS, ALL) with live badge counts and instant client-side
filtering. RLOGIN is selected by default. Supports URL hash deep-linking
(`/games#rlogin`) with browser back/forward support.

### Echo Area Button Mod

Adds a quick network-filter and quick-action button bar to the Echo List page

with live area counts, plus one-click toggles for subscribed-only, unread-only, new
post, and manage subscriptions.
