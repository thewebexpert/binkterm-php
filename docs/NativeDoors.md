Native doors are BBS door programs that run as native Linux binaries or Windows executables, launched directly via PTY (pseudo-terminal). Unlike DOS doors, they require no emulator — the program runs as a regular system process with full ANSI/VT100 terminal support.

## Multiplexing Bridge Setup

Native doors use the same multiplexing bridge as DOS doors. Before native doors will work, the bridge must be installed and running.

**Quick start:**

```bash
# Install bridge dependencies (includes node-pty for native door PTY support)
cd scripts/dosbox-bridge
npm install

# Start the bridge (interactive)
node multiplexing-server.js

# Or run as a background daemon
node multiplexing-server.js --daemon
```

For full setup instructions including production service configuration, environment variables, and reverse proxy setup, see [Doors.md](Doors.md).

---

## How It Works

1. A user clicks **Launch** on a native door from the `/games` page.
2. The web interface creates a door session via the API and opens the xterm.js terminal player in an iframe.
3. The multiplexing bridge (Node.js) reads the session from the database, spawns the door executable via `node-pty`, and bridges the WebSocket to the PTY.
4. A DOOR.SYS drop file is written to `native-doors/drops/NODE{n}/DOOR.SYS` and user data is injected as environment variables.
5. When the door exits (or the user disconnects), the PTY is killed and the session is cleaned up.

```

Each door lives in its own subdirectory under `native-doors/doors/`. The directory name is the door's ID — it is used in URLs and the database, so it must be lowercase with no spaces (e.g. `lord`, `mygame`, `linuxdoortest`).

## Creating a New Door

### 1. Create the door directory

```bash
mkdir -p native-doors/doors/mydoor
```

### 2. Create the manifest

The easiest way is through the admin interface:

1. Go to **Admin → Native Doors**.
2. In the **Add New Door** panel, find your door directory and click **Create Manifest**.
3. Fill in the form. Set **Executable** to the script or binary that launches the door (e.g. `mydoor.sh`).
4. Click **Create Manifest** to save.

The manifest is saved as `native-doors/doors/mydoor/nativedoor.json`. See the [manifest format](#nativedoorjson-format) section for the full field reference. A minimal example:

```json
{
  "type": "nativedoor",
  "version": "1.0",
  "managed": "web",
  "game": {
    "name": "My Door",
    "short_name": "MYDOOR",
    "author": "Author Name",
    "version": "1.0",
    "release_year": 2026,
    "description": "A short description shown in the game library.",
    "genre": ["Action"],
    "players": "Single-player",
    "icon": null,
    "screenshot": null
  },
  "door": {
    "executable": "mydoor.sh",
    "launch_command": "/bin/bash mydoor.sh",
    "dropfile_format": "DOOR.SYS",
    "max_nodes": 10,
    "ansi_required": false,
    "time_per_day": 30
  },
  "requirements": {
    "admin_only": false
  },
  "config": {
    "enabled": false,
    "credit_cost": 0,
    "max_time_minutes": 30,
    "max_sessions": 10
  }
}
```

### 3. Place the executable

Copy your program into the door directory. Make sure it is executable on Linux:

```bash
chmod +x native-doors/doors/mydoor/mydoor.sh
```

For compiled binaries, the same applies:

```bash
chmod +x native-doors/doors/mydoor/mydoor
```

### 4. Enable the door in the admin panel

1. Go to **Admin → Native Doors**.
2. Click **Sync Doors** to import newly installed doors.
3. Find your door in the list and toggle it on.
4. Click **Save Configuration**.

The door will now appear in the `/games` game library.

#### Launch command placeholders

The `launch_command` string may contain the following placeholders, which are substituted at launch time:

| Placeholder | Replaced with |
|-------------|---------------|
| `{node}` | Node number (e.g. `1`) |
| `{dropfile}` | Full path to the DOOR.SYS file (e.g. `/srv/bbs/native-doors/drops/NODE1/DOOR.SYS`) |
| `{user_number}` | BBS user ID (numeric) |
| `{homedir}` | Full path to the user's private per-door home directory (e.g. `/srv/bbs/data/users/42/mydoor`), for doors that keep their own state — save games, per-user config overlays, etc. Created automatically before launch if it does not already exist. Also available as the `DOOR_HOME` environment variable |

**Examples:**

```json
"launch_command": "/bin/bash mydoor.sh"
"launch_command": "./mydoor --node {node} --dropfile {dropfile}"
"launch_command": "cmd.exe /c mydoor.bat"
"launch_command": "./mydoor --node {node} --dropfile {dropfile} -home {homedir}"
```

If `launch_command` is omitted, `executable` is used directly as the command with no arguments.

### `requirements` object

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `admin_only` | boolean | `false` | If `true`, only admin users can launch the door |

### `config` object

These are the default settings applied when a door is first synced. They can be overridden at any time through **Admin → Native Doors** without editing the manifest.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Whether the door is available to users. Always `false` in the manifest — enable through the admin panel |
| `credit_cost` | integer | `0` | Credits deducted per session launch (0 = free) |
| `max_time_minutes` | integer | `30` | Maximum session length in minutes |
| `max_sessions` | integer | `10` | Maximum concurrent sessions |

---

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are set in the door process at launch:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DOOR_USER_NAME` | User's handle | `Sysop` |
| `DOOR_USER_REAL_NAME` | User's real name | `John Smith` |
| `DOOR_USER_NUMBER` | BBS user ID (numeric) | `42` |
| `DOOR_NODE` | Node number | `1` |
| `DOOR_BBS_NAME` | BBS name from configuration | `My BBS` |
| `DOOR_DROPFILE` | Full path to the drop file | `/srv/bbs/native-doors/drops/NODE1/DOOR.SYS` |
| `BBSDEV_DRP` | Full path to the `BBSDEV.DRP` file (only when `dropfile_format` is `BBSDEV.DRP`) | `/srv/bbs/native-doors/drops/NODE1/BBSDEV.DRP` |
| `DOOR_ANSI` | Always `1` (ANSI assumed) | `1` |
| `TERM` | Terminal type | `xterm-256color` |

The process also inherits the environment of the multiplexing bridge, including `PATH`.

---

## Drop File

A drop file is generated and written to `native-doors/drops/NODE{n}/` before the door is launched. Three formats are supported, selected via `dropfile_format` in the manifest:

### DOOR.SYS (default)

The classic 52-line format compatible with most traditional BBS door games. Written to `DOOR.SYS`.

```json
"dropfile_format": "DOOR.SYS"
```

### DOOR32.SYS

An 11-line format designed for modern doors, as an alternative to DOOR.SYS's serial/FOSSIL-oriented fields. Written to `DOOR32.SYS`. Native doors are spawned over a PTY (stdio), not a telnet socket, so comm type is `0` (local/stdio) here — not the `2` (telnet/socket) a real telnet-gatewayed door would see.

```json
"dropfile_format": "DOOR32.SYS"
```

The DOOR32.SYS fields are:

| Line | Field | Value |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Comm type | `0` (local/stdio) |
| 2 | Comm handle | `0` |
| 3 | Baud rate | `0` |
| 4 | BBS name | From user data |
| 5 | User record number | From user data |
| 6 | User's real name | From user data |
| 7 | User's handle/alias | From user data |
| 8 | Security level | From user data |
| 9 | Time left (minutes) | From user data |
| 10 | ANSI | `1` (always) |
| 11 | Node number | Session node number |

### BBSDEV.DRP (experimental — untested)

> **Experimental.** This format is implemented per the [BBSDEV.DRP v1.0 spec](https://realdeuce.github.io/bbsdev.drp/) but has not been tested against a real door. Report issues on GitHub.

A modern, line-oriented drop file: exactly 19 lines, UTF-8 without BOM, CRLF line endings. Written to `BBSDEV.DRP`. The absolute path is also passed to the door in the `BBSDEV_DRP` environment variable (the legacy `DOOR_DROPFILE` variable is still set as well).

```json
"dropfile_format": "BBSDEV.DRP"
```

| Line | Field | Value |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Format version | `1.0` |
| 2 | Communications type | `stdio` (native doors run over a PTY) |
| 3 | Communications parameters | empty |
| 4 | User alias | username (`Guest` for anonymous) |
| 5 | Unique user key | numeric user ID |
| 6 | Screen width | door `terminal_size` width, default `80` |
| 7 | Screen height | door `terminal_size` height, default `25` |
| 8 | ANSI enabled | `Y` |
| 9 | RIP enabled | `N` |
| 10 | CTerm version | empty |
| 11 | Logoff deadline | empty (no forced logoff) |
| 12 | Terminal encoding | `IBM437` when `output_encoding` is `cp437`, otherwise `UTF-8` |
| 13 | Language | user locale as a BCP 47 tag, default `en-US` |
| 14 | BBS software | `BinktermPHP <version>` |
| 15 | Board name | BBS name |
| 16 | Sysop alias | sysop name |
| 17 | Access level | `sysop` for admin accounts, otherwise `50` |
| 18 | Node number | session node number |
| 19 | Show local display | `N` |

A door configured for `BBSDEV.DRP` receives only that file — no `DOOR.SYS` is written.

The same user data is also available via environment variables (see above), so simple doors do not need to parse any drop file format at all.

---

## Terminal Settings

Doors run in an `xterm-256color` PTY. ANSI escape sequences are passed through directly — no character encoding conversion is applied (unlike DOS doors which convert CP437). Write UTF-8 or plain ANSI to stdout.

### Terminal size

The default PTY size is **80 columns × 25 rows**. For doors that benefit from a wider canvas (such as PubTerm), the initial terminal dimensions can be set per-door in `config/nativedoors.json` via the `terminal_size` key:

```json
{
  "pubterm": {
    "enabled": true,
    "terminal_size": "132x43"
  }
}
```

Accepted values are `"WxH"` strings (e.g. `"80x25"`, `"132x24"`, `"132x43"`, `"132x50"`) or `"autofit"` to size the canvas to the user's browser window. The PTY is spawned at the configured dimensions and the BBS receives the correct NAWS terminal size at connection time.

> **Note:** `"autofit"` sizes the xterm.js canvas to fill the browser window and sets the initial BBS dimensions accordingly. Mid-session resize (NAWS updates when the user resizes their browser) is not currently supported — the system `telnet` client used by PubTerm does not forward PTY window-change signals to the BBS. The BBS will start at the correct size but will not adapt if the user resizes their browser mid-session.

The `terminal_size` setting is read from `config/nativedoors.json` (the admin-configurable runtime config) rather than the static `nativedoor.json` manifest, so it can be changed through **Admin → Native Doors** without touching the door files.

---

## Platform Notes

### Linux

- Shell scripts must have a shebang line (e.g. `#!/bin/bash`)
- Compiled binaries must be built for the host architecture
- Executables must have the execute bit set (`chmod +x`)

### Windows

- Use `cmd.exe /c` in `launch_command` for `.bat` files:
  ```json
  "launch_command": "cmd.exe /c mydoor.bat"
  ```
- Use the full path to an interpreter if it is not on `PATH`

---

## Configuration File

Runtime configuration (enabled/disabled, credit cost, session limits) is stored in `config/nativedoors.json`. This file is managed by the admin panel and the admin daemon — **do not edit it directly while the BBS is running**.

The file structure is a JSON object keyed by door ID:

```json
{
  "linuxdoortest": {
    "enabled": true,
    "credit_cost": 0,
    "max_time_minutes": 30,
    "max_sessions": 10
  },
  "mydoor": {
    "enabled": false,
    "credit_cost": 5,
    "max_time_minutes": 60,
    "max_sessions": 5
  }
}
```

All supported keys per door entry:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | boolean | `false` | Whether the door is available to users |
| `credit_cost` | integer | `0` | Credits deducted per session |
| `max_time_minutes` | integer | `30` | Maximum session length in minutes |
| `max_sessions` | integer | `10` | Maximum concurrent sessions |
| `allow_anonymous` | boolean | `false` | Allow unauthenticated guest access (requires `credit_cost: 0`) |
| `guest_max_sessions` | integer | `2` | Maximum concurrent guest sessions when `allow_anonymous` is true |
| `terminal_size` | string | `"80x25"` | Initial PTY and canvas dimensions. Accepted values: `"80x25"`, `"132x24"`, `"132x43"`, `"132x50"`, or `"autofit"`. See [Terminal Settings](#terminal-settings) |
| `hide_from_web` | boolean | `false` | When `true`, hides this door from the web games list and blocks its `/games/nativedoors/{doorid}` web player page (`404`). The door remains launchable over telnet/SSH via **[Files] → Door Games** (`telnet/src/DoorHandler.php`), since that path calls `POST /api/door/launch` directly rather than going through the web listing/player route. Use this for doors that only make sense in a terminal (e.g. FOSSIL/ANSI-only games) or that a sysop wants restricted to the terminal server. |

---

## Included Test Doors

Two test doors are bundled in `native-doors/doors/` to verify the system is working:

| Door ID | Platform | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `linuxdoortest` | Linux | Bash script — displays "hello world" and waits for a keypress |
| `windoortest` | Windows | Batch file — displays "hello world" and waits for a keypress |

Both are disabled by default. Enable them through **Admin → Native Doors** to test your setup.

---

## Security Warning

> **Only install native doors from sources you trust.**

Native doors run as the same operating system user as the BinktermPHP web server and multiplexing bridge. A door that drops to a shell, spawns subprocesses, or reads arbitrary files on disk does so with the full permissions of that user — including access to your database credentials, configuration files, private keys, and all BBS data.

**Key risks to be aware of:**

- **Shell escape** — if a door provides any mechanism to execute shell commands (e.g. a built-in editor, help viewer using `less`, or debug mode), a user can break out and run arbitrary commands on the server.
- **File system access** — the door can read and write any file the web server user can access, including `.env`, `config/binkp.json`, and the database.
- **Network access** — the door can make outbound network connections.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Door does not appear in the game library after sync**
- Confirm `nativedoor.json` exists in the door directory and is valid JSON
- Check that `"type": "nativedoor"` and `"game.name"` are present
- Check the PHP error log for manifest parse errors

**Door launches but the screen is blank**
- Confirm the executable exists and is executable (`chmod +x`)
- Confirm the `launch_command` path is correct
- Test the command manually in a terminal to verify it runs

**Door exits immediately**
- Run the executable manually in a terminal to see error output
- Check that all required dependencies (libraries, interpreters) are installed on the host

**Drop file is not being written**
- Confirm `native-doors/drops/` exists and is writable by the user running the bridge
- The bridge creates `NODE{n}` subdirectories automatically

**Session does not clean up after exit**
- Ensure the door process exits cleanly when stdin is closed or a hangup signal (`SIGHUP`) is received
- The bridge sends `SIGHUP` to the PTY when the user disconnects
