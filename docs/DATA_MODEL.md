## Core Message Tables

### `echomail`

The central table. Stores every public FTN message received or posted.

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `id` | Primary key |
| `echoarea_id` | FK → `echoareas.id` |
| `from_name` | Sender's display name (FTN real name) |
| `from_address` | Sender's FTN address (zone:net/node.point) |
| `to_name` | Addressee (usually `All` for public posts) |
| `subject` | Message subject line |
| `body` | Full message text |
| `date_written` | Timestamp from the FTN packet header (unreliable — sender's clock) |
| `date_received` | Server-side timestamp set at import (`NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'`) — always reliable |
| `message_id` | The FTN `@MSGID` kludge value; used for deduplication and threading |
| `reply_to_id` | FK → `echomail.id`; self-referential parent for thread walks |
| `kludge_lines` | Raw kludge lines from the original packet (includes `CHRS`, `TZUTC`, etc.) |
| `message_charset` | Normalized charset for encoding/decoding (e.g. `CP437`, `UTF-8`) |
| `art_format` | Set when the message is ANSI, Sixel, RIPscrip, etc. |

**Key rule**: prefer `date_received` for display ordering; show `date_written` only as supplementary information (it can be wrong or in the future if the sender's clock is off). Future-dated `date_written` values are suppressed from message list queries until they are no longer in the future.

### `netmail`

Private point-to-point FTN messages. Structure mirrors `echomail` but without an `echoarea_id`, and with a real `to_address` (the recipient's FTN address). Soft-delete is per side (`deleted_by_sender` / `deleted_by_recipient`); read state is per-user in `message_read_status`. Attachments are rows in the `files` table (`message_type = 'netmail'`). **`user_id` is not reliably the mailbox owner** — see [Netmail.md](Netmail.md) for the ownership and visibility rules.

### `echoareas`

One row per echo area (conference/forum).

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `id` | Primary key |
| `tag` | Area tag (e.g. `GENERAL`) — case-insensitive in queries |
| `domain` | Network domain (e.g. `fidonet`, `lovlynet`) — allows the same tag in multiple networks |
| `description` | Human-readable area name |
| `is_local` | When true, messages are never forwarded to uplinks |
| `is_active` | Inactive areas are hidden from all queries and API responses |
| `is_sysop_only` | When true, only admin users can see the area |
| `moderator` | FTN address of the area moderator, if any |
| `missing_chrs_charset` | Optional fallback charset used only when inbound FTN messages for this area have no `CHRS` kludge |

The `(tag, domain)` pair is the logical key. Code that looks up areas by tag must also filter by domain when multiple networks are connected.

---

## User Tables

### `users`

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `id` | Primary key |
| `username` | Login identifier — unique, case-insensitive |
| `real_name` | FTN display name used in message headers — unique, case-insensitive |
| `password_hash` | bcrypt hash |
| `is_active` | Soft-delete / pending approval flag |
| `is_approved` | Set by admin after registration review |
| `is_admin` | Full sysop access |
| `credit_balance` | Current credit balance (modified only via `user_transactions`) |
| `last_login` | Timestamp of most recent login |
| `referral_code` | For the referral system |

Both `username` and `real_name` are enforced as unique to prevent impersonation. A database trigger fires on insert/update to catch collisions across both columns simultaneously.

### `users_meta`

Key-value store for arbitrary user metadata.

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `user_id` | FK → `users.id` |
| `keyname` | String key (e.g. `mcp_serverkey`, `user_settings`) |
| `valname` | String value (may be JSON for structured data) |

Used for: MCP bearer keys, per-user AI and display settings, daily login tracking, and other extensible preferences. Unique index on `(user_id, keyname)`.

### `user_transactions`

Append-only credit ledger. Every credit change goes through here via `UserCredit::transact()`. The `users.credit_balance` column is the running total; `user_transactions` is the audit trail.

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `user_id` | FK → `users.id` |
| `amount` | Positive for credit, negative for debit |
| `description` | Human-readable reason (e.g. `Daily login bonus`, `Netmail sent`) |
| `created_at` | Transaction timestamp |

---

## FTN Network Tables

### `echoareas`

See [Core Message Tables](#core-message-tables) above.

### `user_echoarea_subscriptions`

Many-to-many join between users and echo areas. Controls which areas appear in a user's message list and which areas the system exports to each uplink.

### `nodelist` / `nodelist_metadata` / `nodelist_flags`

Imported FTN nodelist data. `nodelist` holds one row per node (zone, net, node, point, name, location, sysop, phone, baud, flags). `nodelist_metadata` tracks the import date and nodelist edition. `nodelist_flags` normalizes the per-node capability flags.

### `binkp_session_log`

One row per completed binkp session (inbound or outbound). Records duration, bytes exchanged, files transferred, and outcome. Used by the admin analytics dashboard.

---

## Real-Time Tables

### `sse_events`

The inter-process event bus. Any code can insert a row; BinkStream delivers it to connected browsers. Defined as `UNLOGGED` so inserts are fast — rows are transient delivery state, not persistent data.

| Column | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| `id` | Monotonic sequence — used as the stream cursor |
| `event_type` | String type name (e.g. `chat_message`, `new_echomail`) |
| `payload` | JSONB — fat payload containing all fields needed to render the event |
| `user_id` | FK → `users.id` — if set, only that user receives the event |
| `admin_only` | When true, only admin users receive the event |
| `created_at` | Pruned after one hour by the admin daemon |

See [BinkStreamChannel.md](BinkStreamChannel.md) for the full architecture.

| `meshcore_contacts` | MeshCore companion contact list; rows are created by the bridge or pre-registered by users; `pub_key_full` is unique when known (partial unique index); `user_id` links to the owning BBS user |
| `meshcore_device_commands` | Queue of pending commands to be executed on a MeshCore radio by the bridge (e.g. `remove_contact`); populated on contact deletion; bridge polls and ACKs each row |
| `bulletins` / `bulletin_reads` | Sysop bulletin board |

| `disposable_email_domains` | Cached disposable/throwaway email provider domains for the registration-screening `disposable_email` signal; refreshed every 24h by `binkp_scheduler.php` via `scripts/update_disposable_email_list.php` |
| `screening_list_refresh` | Last-run/status tracking for screening cache-list refresh jobs, so the scheduler can gate them to a fixed interval |

---

### `shared_messages`

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `share_key` | `TEXT` | 32-char hex identifier, used in `/shared/{shareKey}` URLs |
| `message_id` / `message_type` | `INTEGER` / `TEXT` | References the shared echomail or netmail row |
| `shared_by_user_id` | `INTEGER` | FK → `users.id` |
| `area_identifier` | `TEXT` | Echoarea tag (used in friendly-URL slugs) |
| `slug` | `TEXT` | Human-readable URL slug (e.g. `hello-world`) |
| `og_image_path` | `TEXT` | Absolute filesystem path to the uploaded OG preview image |
| `og_image_slug` | `TEXT` | Filename with extension (e.g. `abc123….jpg`); used as the URL parameter for `/shared-image/{og_image_slug}` |
| `ai_og_summary` | `TEXT` | AI-generated summary injected into `og:description` |
| `is_active` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether the share link is live |
| `is_public` | `BOOLEAN` | Whether anyone can view without authentication |
| `expires_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Optional expiry; `NULL` means never expires |
| `access_count` | `INTEGER` | Running count of page views |

The `og_image_slug` is stored as the basename of `og_image_path` and is the canonical URL parameter for `/shared-image/`. Because it includes the file extension, social media crawlers can infer the image format from the URL.

### `auto_feed_sources` / `auto_feed_source_echoareas`

`auto_feed_sources` stores the source-level Auto Feed configuration: feed URL, optional display name, source type, poster name, polling state, deduplication marker, and posting counters.

`auto_feed_source_echoareas` is the many-to-many join table that maps one source row to one or more target `echoareas` rows. Auto Feed polls one source row, then fans each newly discovered article out to every linked target area.

### `nntp_article_numbers` / `nntp_area_watermark`

Per-echoarea NNTP article numbering for the NNTP server (`docs/NNTP.md`). NNTP
requires per-group article numbers that are dense and never reused within a group
(RFC 3977); `echomail.id` is a single sequence shared across all areas and cannot
provide that.

`nntp_article_numbers`:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `echoarea_id` | `INTEGER` | FK → `echoareas.id` (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) |
| `article_number` | `BIGINT` | The area-local NNTP article number |
| `echomail_id` | `INTEGER` | FK → `echomail.id` (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) |

Primary key `(echoarea_id, article_number)`; unique index `(echoarea_id, echomail_id)`.

`nntp_area_watermark`:

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `echoarea_id` | `INTEGER` | PK, FK → `echoareas.id` (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) |
| `last_article_number` | `BIGINT` | Highest article number ever allocated in the area |

Numbers are allocated lazily by the NNTP daemon (`src/Nntp/NntpArticleNumbers.php`)
the first time an area is read, in `echomail.id` order. `last_article_number` only
ever increases, so when an `echomail` row is pruned its mapping row is removed
(cascade) but the number is retired — never reissued.

The most important relationship for day-to-day development is `users → user_echoarea_subscriptions → echoareas → echomail`. Almost every message-related query joins these four tables.
