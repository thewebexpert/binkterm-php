# Project: binkterm-php

> **Note:** The internal/repository name is `binkterm-php`, but the product name is **BinktermPHP**. Use "BinktermPHP" in all user-facing text, documentation, and UI copy.

## Project Description

BinktermPHP is a multi-protocol BBS platform built around native FTN messaging. It provides a full browser-based community interface with a native BinkP mailer, a real-time event bus, and a door game framework — accessible from browsers, Telnet/SSH terminals, Gemini clients, QWK readers, AI assistants, and mesh radio nodes. No third-party mailer required.

 - **Product website**: https://lovelybits.org/binktermphp
 - **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/awehttam/binkterm-php
 - **Support BBS**: https://claudes.lovelybits.org
 - **Reddit**: https://www.reddit.com/r/BinktermPHP/
 - **Product Mascot**: Kludge the Corvid
 - **Default PR target branch**: `claudesbbs` — all pull requests must target this branch, not `main`
 - **New development branches**: When creating a new branch, always ask the user whether to branch from `claudesbbs` (main staging) or another development branch. Never assume `main`.

## Tech Stack

 - Frontend: jQuery, Bootstrap 5
 - Backend: PHP 8.2+ (requires minimum 8.2), SimpleRouter request library, Twig templates
 - Database: Postgres
 - Dependencies: Composer
 - Real-time: BinkStream (WebSocket + SSE via SharedWorker)


## Code Conventions

 - camelCase for variables and functions
 - PascalCase for components and classes
 - 4 space indents
 - **Markdown over HTML**: Prefer Markdown for any user-facing customizable text fields (admin settings, content panels, footers, etc.). Only use raw HTML when Markdown cannot express the needed formatting.
 - **Environment Variables**: Use `Config::env('VAR_NAME', 'default')` for application configuration values that come from the project's `.env` file. Direct `getenv()` reads are allowed for process/runtime environment inspection that is not part of BinktermPHP config resolution, such as searching the OS `PATH` inside a daemon helper. Do NOT use `$_ENV` directly for application config.
 - **Client-side storage**: Always use `UserStorage` (from `public_html/js/user-storage.js`) instead of `localStorage` directly. `UserStorage` automatically scopes keys by the logged-in user's ID so that different accounts on the same browser cannot share state. When not logged in it falls back to `sessionStorage` to avoid persisting anonymous state.

## Logging

**Never use `error_log()` for web/application logging** (except inside `src/Binkp/Logger.php` itself and `src/Admin/AdminDaemonClient.php` where it is the last-resort fallback). All web-side and shared application logging must go through `BinktermPHP\Binkp\Logger`. Use `getServerLogger()` in route files. Exception: self-contained daemon/runtime subsystems that do not run in the web request context, such as the Telnet/ZMODEM runtime under `telnet/src/`, may use targeted `error_log(..., 3, $file)` file logging when that is the established subsystem-local mechanism. When wiring up a new component, invoke the `/logging-guide` skill.

## Project Structure

 - src/ - main source code. See `src/Binkp/CLAUDE.md` for BinkP protocol implementation notes.
 - routes/ - HTTP route definitions (api-routes.php, web-routes.php, admin-routes.php, etc.)
 - config/ - runtime configuration files (binkp.json, bbs.json, webdoors.json, etc.) and i18n catalogs
 - scripts/ - CLI tools (binkp_server, binkp_poll, maintenance scripts, etc.). See `scripts/CLAUDE.md` for CLI script rules.
 - templates/ - html templates. See `templates/CLAUDE.md` for template resolution rules.
 - docs/ - system documentation; often contains historical programming notes that give insight into how specific subsystems were designed and why. Read relevant docs/ files before working on a subsystem — they frequently contain architectural context not obvious from the code alone.
 - public_html/ - the web site files, static assets
 - tests/ - PHPUnit and Playwright test suites
 - vendor/ - 3rd party libraries managed by composer and should not be touched by Claude
 - data/ - runtime data (logs, inbound/outbound FTN packets)
 - telnet/ - the telnet BBS server (separate from the web interface). See `telnet/CLAUDE.md` for daemon include-list rules.
 - ssh/ - the SSH daemon; shares terminal-side classes with the telnet daemon. See `ssh/CLAUDE.md`.
 - dosbox-bridge/ - DOS door runtime data and bridge
 - tools/ - support and utility tools (e.g. support-bot)

## Credits

 - **CREDITS.md must be kept up to date**: When merging commits from a new contributor, add them to the Contributors table. When adding a new vendor library via composer, add it to the Third-Party Libraries section with its license and authors.

## Important Notes
 - **Admin UI over config files**: In documentation and user-facing instructions, always direct users to configure settings through the BBS admin web interface rather than by manually editing JSON config files (`binkp.json`, `bbs.json`, `webdoors.json`, etc.). Only fall back to describing direct file edits when the feature genuinely has no admin UI, or when writing developer/contributor documentation where direct file access is appropriate. Some settings that were historically configured in `binkp.json` per-uplink (e.g. `allow_markup`, `allow_media`, `default_charset`, `posting_name_policy`) have since moved to **Admin → Networks**; the uplink-level flags are kept only for backwards compatibility. Always document the Networks UI as the current path.
 - User authentication is simple username and password with long lived cookie
 - Both usernames and Real Names are considered unique. Two users cannot have the same username or real name
 - The web interface should use ajax requests by api for queries
 - This is for FTN style networks and forums
 - **Never use `1:1/1` as a test/example FTN address**: it's a real, well-known Zone Coordinator address in live FidoNet. Using it in test data, fixtures, docs, or example configs risks confusing it with a real network node. Also avoid reusing any address that is actually configured in this project's own `config/binkp.json` (system address, or any uplink's `me`/`address`) as a generic example, since that's a real live node too — pick an obviously fictitious zone/net/node instead (e.g. `999:1/1`).
 - When adding features to netmail and echomail, keep in mind feature parity. Ask for clarification about whether a feature is appropriate to both
 - **User settings parity**: When adding a new setting to `user_settings`, try to keep parity between the web UI/API flow and the term server flow. Check both the web-side handlers (for example `src/MessageHandler.php`, `routes/api-routes.php`, `public_html/js/app.js`) and the term-side settings path (`telnet/src/SettingsHandler.php`) so the setting is available and persisted consistently where appropriate.
 - **Premium features**: When adding, changing, or removing any registered-only / premium feature, gate it with `License::isValid()`. Do **not** use `License::hasFeature()` — it is not yet implemented. Update the "Currently Implemented Premium Features" table in `docs/proposals/PremiumFeatures.md` and remove it from the future ideas list if it was listed there.
 - Leave the vendor directory alone. It's managed by composer only
 - **Keep the Dockerfile in sync with new dependencies**: When adding a new PHP extension requirement (composer.json `ext-*`, or any code using a PHP extension function), a new required system package, or a new required `-dev` header package, update `Dockerfile` to install it too — both the `docker-php-ext-install` list and the `apt-get install` package list (including the corresponding `-dev` package needed to compile the extension, e.g. `libxml2-dev` for `dom`/`xml`, `libonig-dev` for `mbstring`, `libgmp-dev` for `gmp`). `docs/INSTALL.md`'s package list is the reference for what a bare-metal install requires; the Dockerfile should require the same set. Don't assume an extension ships by default in the `php:8.2-apache` base image — verify or ask.
 - When updating style.css, also update the theme stylesheets: amber.css, dark.css, greenterm.css, and cyberpunk.css
 - **Theme-safe background colors**: Never use Bootstrap 5.3+ utility classes like `bg-body-tertiary` or `bg-body-secondary` — they have no theme overrides and will render incorrectly on dark/amber/greenterm/cyberpunk themes. Use `bg-light` instead, which all themes override via `.bg-light { background-color: var(--theme-var) !important; }`.
 - **Service Worker Cache**: When making changes to CSS or JavaScript files, or when updating i18n language strings in `config/i18n/`, increment the CACHE_NAME version in public_html/sw.js (e.g., 'binkcache-v2' to 'binkcache-v3') to force clients to download fresh copies. The service worker caches static assets and the i18n catalog (`/api/i18n/catalog`) to bypass aggressive browser caching on mobile devices.
 - **BinkStream SharedWorker Build**: When making changes to `public_html/js/binkstream-worker-v2.js`, increment `WORKER_BUILD` in `public_html/js/binkstream-client.js`. This constant is embedded in both the worker URL (`?v=N`) and the worker name (`binkstream-vN`). Because SharedWorkers are shared across tabs and survive page reloads, the browser will keep running the old worker code until all tabs are closed — bumping `WORKER_BUILD` forces a new worker instance immediately without requiring users to close every tab.
 - **Timezone Display**: Dates and times are generally stored as UTC in the database. When presenting them to users, translate them to the user's own timezone unless there is a specific reason to show raw UTC.
 - **date_written vs date_received**: On `echomail` and `netmail`, `date_written` is derived from the FTN packet header (local time converted to UTC via the TZUTC kludge) and reflects when the sender composed the message — it can be wrong or in the future if the remote sysop's clock is incorrect. `date_received` is set server-side via `NOW() AT TIME ZONE 'UTC'` and is always reliable. Future-dated `date_written` values are hidden from message list queries until they are no longer in the future. When displaying dates to users, prefer `date_received` for ordering/display by default; show `date_written` with a tooltip that also includes `date_received` so discrepancies are visible.
 - **Charset columns**: The `message_charset` column on `echomail` and `netmail` stores the canonical iconv-compatible charset name (e.g. `CP437`, `UTF-8`) as normalized by `BinkpConfig::normalizeCharset()`. The raw `CHRS` value from the original FTN packet is preserved as-is in the `kludge_lines` column and may differ (e.g. `IBMPC`, `ASCII`). Always use `message_charset` for encoding/decoding operations and pre-selecting the charset UI; read `kludge_lines` only when you need the original wire value.
 - See FAQ.md for common questions and troubleshooting
 - To get a database connection use `$db = Database::getInstance()->getPdo()`
 - Don't edit postgres_schema.sql unless specifically instructed to. Database changes are migration-based; invoke the `/new-migration` skill when creating a migration.
 - Avoid duplicating code. Whenever possible centralize methods using a class.
 - **Git Workflow**: Do NOT stage or commit changes until explicitly instructed. Changes should be tested first before committing to git. **Never use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or any bulk/wildcard staging.** Stage only the specific files you worked on, by explicit path. The repo intentionally carries many untracked files (and a stray `nul` path) that bulk staging would wrongly add or abort on.
 - When writing out a proposal document state in the preamble that the proposal is a draft, was generated by AI and may not have been reviewed for accuracy.
 - When writing proposal or other documentation files, use repo-relative paths like `src/Foo.php` or `docs/Bar.md` in the document text; do not use full filesystem paths.
 - **Doc maintenance**: When adding features that touch a subsystem with a dedicated `docs/` file, **you must update that file**. Consult the **Doc Maintenance Checklist** in `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for the full list of subsystem→doc pairings. When adding a new documentation file to `docs/` (excluding `docs/proposals/`), update `docs/index.md` to include it in operational priority order; when creating a new `UPGRADING_x.y.z.md` file, also add it to the Upgrading section of `docs/index.md`, newest-first.
 - For version bump steps and UPGRADING doc format, invoke the `/bump-version` skill.
 - **UPGRADING doc content rules**: Do not include sentences stating that no configuration is needed, no sysop action is required, or no migration is required. These are filler — omit them entirely.
 - When creating or modifying a WebDoor, invoke the `/new-webdoor` skill.
 - Write phpDoc blocks when possible

## PostgreSQL Gotchas

 - **Boolean handling:** When binding boolean values to prepared statements, convert them to strings `'true'` or `'false'` instead of using PHP boolean values. Example: `$isActive ? 'true' : 'false'`
 - **Insert IDs:** Do not use `PDO::lastInsertId()`. On PostgreSQL it calls `lastval()` which returns the last sequence value used in the **current session** — from *any* sequence, not necessarily the row you just inserted. Always use `RETURNING id` and fetch the returned row directly:
   ```php
   // WRONG — do not rely on session-wide lastval()/lastInsertId()
   $stmt->execute();
   $id = $this->db->lastInsertId();

   // CORRECT — fetch the inserted row's id directly
   $stmt->execute();
   $row = $stmt->fetch(\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
   $id = $row ? (int)$row['id'] : 0;
   ```
 - **Future compatibility guidance:** PostgreSQL is the only supported database backend. New work may use PostgreSQL-specific features when they materially improve correctness, simplicity, or performance, but avoid unnecessary lock-in when it is easy not to. Keep PostgreSQL-specific SQL isolated rather than scattered, route new realtime/event signaling through an abstraction or service layer rather than direct `pg_*` calls where practical, and update `docs/PostgreSQLDependencies.md` when adding a new PostgreSQL-specific dependency that future compatibility work would need to account for.

## Internationalization (i18n) & Encoding Policy
- **Strict UTF-8 (No BOM):** All i18n catalogs and source files must be saved as UTF-8 without a Byte Order Mark.
- **Accent Handling:** When editing French or other accented catalogs, use literal characters (e.g., 'é', 'à') only. Never use HTML entities (e.g., &eacute;) or Unicode escape sequences unless explicitly requested.
- **No Emojis/4-Byte Characters:** Strictly prohibit the use of Emojis or any character outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (U+0000 to U+FFFF). These break legacy FTN/BBS terminal rendering.
- **Verification Step:** Before completing a translation task, verify that you haven't "double-encoded" characters (e.g., ensuring 'é' doesn't become 'Ã©').
- **ASCII quotes only in PHP catalog files:** PHP string delimiters must be ASCII single quotes (U+0027). **U+2018 `'` and U+2019 `'` (curly/smart quotes) must never appear anywhere in a catalog file** — not as delimiters, not as apostrophes in values. This is an absolute rule with no exceptions. PHP 8 treats these characters as Unicode identifier bytes, so a curly quote used as a key delimiter passes `php -l` cleanly but throws a fatal `Undefined constant` at runtime. A curly quote used as an apostrophe inside a value is "technically valid" PHP today but is fragile: the Edit tool can reproduce it as a delimiter when it rewrites the surrounding context, even on lines whose values contain no apostrophe at all.
- **Apostrophes in catalog values must be escaped:** Any apostrophe inside a PHP string value must be written as `\'`. Never use a raw ASCII `'` (terminates the string early) or a curly quote U+2019 (see rule above). This applies to all locales, especially French (`l\'`, `d\'`, `qu\'`) and Italian (`l\'`, `all\'`, `dell\'`). When editing any catalog line, always write apostrophes as `\'` in your replacement regardless of how they appeared before.
- **Lint every catalog file you touch:** After writing or editing any `config/i18n/` PHP file, run `php scripts/check_i18n_syntax.php --locale=<locale>` to confirm it passes all three checks (parse, runtime-include, and curly-quote byte scan) before committing. `php -l` alone is not sufficient — it does not catch the curly-quote delimiter class of error.

## Localization (i18n) Workflow

The project uses key-based localization for both Twig and JavaScript. Translation catalogs live in:
- `config/i18n/<locale>/common.php`
- `config/i18n/<locale>/errors.php`

Current locale folders under `config/i18n/` must be kept in sync when adding or renaming keys. Do not update only the language you are actively reading. For any i18n key change, enumerate the actual locale directories on disk under `config/i18n/` and update every real locale folder you find there; do not guess the locale set from memory. Exclude only `config/i18n/overrides/`, which is not a base locale.

**Adding a new language:** New locales are typically added by dropping a `config/i18n/<code>/` directory with translated `common.php` and `errors.php` files. When this happens, also add the locale code and its native display name to the `$names` map in `Translator::getLocaleName()` (`src/I18n/Translator.php`) so it appears correctly in language selectors across both the web and terminal interfaces.

### Core Rules
- Never hardcode new user-facing UI text in templates/JS when adding or changing features.
- Add a translation key first, then use it from Twig/JS.
- Keep every locale in `config/i18n/` in sync for every new key in normal feature work, including `fr` when present.
- Determine the locale set from the filesystem, not from assumption. If `config/i18n/de/`, `config/i18n/it/`, `config/i18n/ru/`, or any future locale directory exists, it must be updated too.
- Prefer stable key names by page/feature area, e.g. `ui.settings.*`, `ui.polls.*`, `errors.polls.*`.
- Do not change existing key names unless required (avoid breaking references).

### Twig Translation
- Use the global Twig function: `t(key, params, namespace)`.
- Default namespace is `common`; pass `'errors'` when needed.
- Example:
```twig
{{ t('ui.settings.title', {}, 'common') }}
{{ t('ui.polls.create.submit', {'cost': poll_cost}, 'common') }}
```

### JavaScript Translation
- Use `window.t(key, params, fallback)` (or a local wrapper like `uiT`).
- Use placeholders in strings and pass params object:
```js
window.t('ui.polls.create.submit', { cost: 25 }, 'Create Poll ({cost} credits)')
```
- `window.i18n` supports lazy namespace loading via:
  - `loadI18nNamespaces([...])`
  - endpoint: `GET /api/i18n/catalog?ns=common,errors&locale=<locale>`
- JS should always include a fallback string for resilience.
- Treat fallback strings as localized UI text too: if you introduce a new fallback in JS/Twig, add the matching `ui.*` or `errors.*` key to every locale directory first instead of inventing a raw English string inline.
- Do not pass new raw English strings directly to helpers like `apiError(...)`, `getApiErrorMessage(...)`, `window.t(...)`, `uiT(...)`, toast helpers, or modal helpers; `php scripts/check_i18n_hardcoded_strings.php` will flag those.

### API Errors and `error_code`
- API responses should use structured errors via `apiError(error_code, message, status, extra)` and return:
  - `error_code` (translation key)
  - `error` (human fallback)
- Frontend should resolve display text with `window.getApiErrorMessage(payload, fallback)`.
- Do not rely on matching raw error message text in frontend logic.
- When wiring frontend error handling, prefer an existing translation key for the fallback; if none exists, add one before writing the JS/Twig.
- For new API errors:
  1. Add/choose `errors.*` key in route code.
  2. Add that key to every locale's `errors.php` file under `config/i18n/`.
  3. Use `getApiErrorMessage` in UI handling.

### Required Validation After i18n Changes
- Run:
  - `php scripts/check_i18n_missing_keys.php`
  - `php scripts/check_i18n_hardcoded_strings.php`
  - `php scripts/check_i18n_error_keys.php`
- Goal:
  - no missing catalog keys in any locale directory under `config/i18n/` (excluding `overrides`)
  - no new hardcoded string violations
  - no missing `errors.*` catalog keys used by `apiError(...)`
  - no locale folders left behind when adding keys

### Practical Checklist for New UI/API Work
1. Add new `ui.*`/`errors.*` keys to every locale under `config/i18n/` (`en`, `es`, `fr`, etc.).
2. Replace literals in Twig with `t(...)`.
3. Replace JS literals with `window.t(...)` (or `uiT(...)`) fallbacks, but do not invent a new inline fallback unless the corresponding catalog key was added first.
4. Ensure API errors return `error_code`.
5. Run all required i18n check scripts before commit, including `php scripts/check_i18n_missing_keys.php`.
6. **API route changes**: When adding, removing, or modifying routes in `routes/api-routes.php`, update `docs/API.md`. Response tables must be complete: every field typed `object` or `array of objects` must have its sub-fields listed in the same table using dot-notation (`parent.child`) or bracket-notation (`items[].child`). A row typed `object` or `array` with no sub-rows is incomplete and must not be committed. See **Response table format** in `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` for the full rules and an example.

## URL Construction

Always use `Config::getSiteUrl()` for full URL construction — it correctly handles HTTPS proxies via the `SITE_URL` env var:

```php
$url = \BinktermPHP\Config::getSiteUrl() . '/path/to/resource';
```

## Admin Daemon

**The web server process cannot write config files.** Any feature that needs to write `config/lovlynet.json`, `config/binkp.json`, `data/bbs.json`, or similar **must** do so via a command to the admin daemon (`scripts/admin_daemon.php`) — never by calling `file_put_contents()` directly from a route or controller.

When adding new configuration settings, you may need to add or update admin daemon commands. Clarify this before implementing.

## Credit Transaction Security

**CRITICAL**: Credit balance modifications must ONLY occur server-side in PHP. JavaScript requests business actions; the server decides whether credits are involved and performs all transactions internally.

```text
❌ POST /api/credits/deduct   (never expose credit endpoints to JS)
✅ POST /api/webdoor/game/buy-item  (server handles credits internally, returns new balance)
```

JS may display the balance value returned by the server and communicate it to parent windows via `postMessage`. It must never calculate or request credit modifications.

When adding a new UserCredit credit/reward type, invoke the `/usercredits-workflow` skill.

## Skills

When working within any subdirectory, check for the presence of a `CLAUDE.md` file in that directory and follow its instructions in addition to this file.

The following project-scoped skills are available in `.claude/commands/`. When adding a new skill file, add it to this list.

- **`/bump-version`** — version bump steps, UPGRADING doc format and voice rules, composer dependency note
- **`/new-migration`** — migration ID format (authoritative), SQL vs PHP choice, no-duplicate-index rule, setup.php reminder
- **`/usercredits-workflow`** — 5-place checklist for adding new UserCredit types
- **`/logging-guide`** — log file table, per-context code patterns, log levels, adding a new log file
- **`/new-webdoor`** — manifest requirement, SDK require path, API independence rule
- **`/tackleissue <issue#>`** — assign, plan, implement, and close a GitHub issue
- **`/newftn`** — prompt for FTN details and create a migration to insert or update the network
